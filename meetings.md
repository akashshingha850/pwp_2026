### Action points

* Simplily the project scope and make it more feasible for the time we have.
* Focus on the implementation of the Restful API system and utilize minimum 5 resources.
* The Frigate API will be used as a reference for the implementation of the EyesEdge API. MQTT should be used like pub/sub for real-time communication between the edge computer and the API, while the RESTful API will be used for data management and client interactions. documentation link of the frigate API has been updated along with the project repo to reflect this change in design.

## Meeting 2.
* **DATE:17/02/2026**
* **PARTICIPANTS:Akash Bappy, Taufiq Ahmed Mesbahul Islam**
* **TEACHER:Iván Sánchez Milara**

### Action points
* There are some redundency in the database design. In image model for ORM we are using two foreign keys one is camera and another one is motion but the motion model also has a foreign key to camera. So we can remove the camera foreign key from image model and use the one in motion model to get the camera information.
* In the readme file we should documented how to setup the project and run it locally.
* Live streaming is not in the scope of the project. We will focus on the implementation of the RESTful API and the integration of pub/sub for real-time communication between auxilary service and the server.
